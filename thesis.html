      <h2>Project Overview: Designing and Implementing a Microservices-Based E-commerce Platform</h2>
      <div class="project-summary">
        <p>This project was a comprehensive, end-to-end design and implementation of a modern e-commerce platform. Moving beyond traditional monolithic structures, I adopted a microservices architecture to address key industry challenges like scalability, system stability, and ease of maintenance. My role involved the entire product development lifecycle, from initial requirement analysis to system design, implementation, and testing.</p>

      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> My Key Contributions & Product-Oriented Thinking</h2>
      <ul class="contributions-list">
        <li>
          <h3>1. From Problem to Solution: Strategic Shift to Microservices</h3>
          <p>I identified that monolithic architectures, while simple initially, face significant bottlenecks in performance and development agility as user traffic grows. My proposed solution was a complete architectural redesign based on microservices, which provides superior system stability and allows for independent development and deployment of different functional modules (e.g., User, Product, Order services).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. User-Centric Requirement Analysis</h3>
          <p>I defined the platform's core functionalities by analyzing the needs of three key user roles: Customers, Merchants, and Administrators. I utilized <strong>UML Use Case diagrams</strong> to map out critical user journeys, such as user registration/login, product search, cart management, and the checkout process, ensuring a logical and intuitive user experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3. Systematic Architecture & Module Design</h3>
          <p>I deconstructed the complex e-commerce system into eight distinct, self-contained microservice modules. This included User Management, Product Management, Order Management, and more. This modular design, documented through comprehensive architecture diagrams, showcases my ability to break down large-scale problems into manageable, interconnected components.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>4. Data-Driven Design and Validation</h3>
          <p>I designed the database schema using <strong>Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagrams</strong> and defined over thirteen core data tables to support the platform's functions. To ensure the final product met the initial requirements, I conducted thorough black-box functional testing to validate system viability and performance.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
