        <div class="finding-block">
            <h3>Finding 1: The audience is predominantly young, educated, and media-savvy.</h3>
            <p>Demographic analysis revealed that the core audience consists of young, active individuals with strong educational backgrounds. This user profile is highly receptive to online promotions and values content with strong visuals and social sharing potential, providing a clear target for marketing efforts.</p>

            <h3>Finding 2: "Character & Story" are the most discussed elements, with positive sentiment dominating.</h3>
            <p>By scraping and analyzing 500 Weibo comments using Python, I found that narrative and character development were the most frequently mentioned assets. Sentiment analysis confirmed strong audience approval, with 66.8% of comments being neutral and 28.6% positive, indicating that the film's core content deeply resonated with viewers.</p>

        <div class="finding-block">
            <h3>Finding 3: Production quality has a stronger impact on satisfaction than promotional efforts.</h3>
            <p>I built two multiple regression models to compare the influence of production-related factors (e.g., source material, visuals) versus promotional factors (e.g., advertising, word-of-mouth). The results showed that the production model (R² = 0.713) had a significantly higher explanatory power. Notably, "Word of Mouth" was the most potent promotional driver, suggesting that organic marketing is more effective than traditional advertising for this type of content.</p>
