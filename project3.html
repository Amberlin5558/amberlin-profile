      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-flag-usa"></i> Project Objective</h2>
      <p>This project involved developing a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for Pop Mart's expansion into the highly competitive North American market. My role was to analyze the target consumer, define product adaptation and localization strategies, recommend a market entry model, and formulate a detailed promotion and marketing plan to ensure a successful launch.</p>

        <h3>1. Defining the Target User: The North American Gen Z Consumer</h3>
        <p>The first step was to deeply understand the primary consumer group. My analysis identified key preferences of Gen Z, including a focus on brand values, social responsibility, personalization, and a willingness to pay a premium for high-quality, sustainable products. This user profile became the foundation for all subsequent strategic decisions.</p>

        <h3>2. Product Adaptation & Cultural Localization</h3>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from Pop Mart's successful cultural adaptation in Thailand, I proposed a multi-pronged localization strategy for the U.S. market. This included adapting product design to incorporate ESG principles, adjusting pricing and promotional tactics for events like Black Friday, and exploring innovative local channels like vending machines and co-branding with local beverage brands.</p>

        <h3>3. Market Entry & Promotion Strategy</h3>
        <p>I recommended a hybrid "Direct Exporting & Joint Ventures" entry model to balance control with rapid market adaptation. The organizational structure would leverage a Geographic Division and Cross-functional Teams to ensure high efficiency and localization. This was supported by a detailed marketing and promotion plan focusing on social media, targeted advertising (SEO/SEM), and KOL cooperation to build brand awareness and drive sales.</p>
